## Description

This project is a school project made in 5 days. The goals for this project are:
- Skeletal animation player using the WhiteBoxEngine
- Understanding how to compute a 3D Animation using the CPU and the GPU (Hardware skinning)
- Make a good project architecture

## Libraries used
- WhiteBoxEngine (3D Engine: https://github.com/Trizek/WhiteBoxEngine)
- AltMath (Mathematic library made in collaboration with my classmates)

## Build Instructions
The build is in the folder "Build". It's 32 bits platform exclusively (Due to WhiteBoxEngine compatibility). 

WARNING: Sometimes the model won't show up. All you have to do is to close the application and re-open it again. This error is due to resources parsing and comes from the version of WhiteBoxEngine.
